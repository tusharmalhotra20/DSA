# C++ Basics

This repository contains codes/program written in C++ language. The codes are of basic level, good for practice, to one who is just stepped into the world of C++ programming. 

The list to the questions of the programs is given in the repository in form of Pdf named as " Directory.pdf ".

###### You may download MS-Dos Box version-0.74 for Windows here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ptV06g5P5zt3ryw1uI5zrxxg3TeMQCxA

Instructions: 

1. Unzip the file.
2. Paste the DOSBox_TurboC++ forlder in your C:\ drive *and rename it as TurboC++.*
3. Go to C:\TurboC++\TurboC++ and there you will find DOSBox of *type- Application* create the shortcut for this on your desktop.
4. Run DOSBox .
5. It may automatically detect the path for bin folder
OR 
You have to do it manually. By changing drive from Z:\ to C:\ and then C:\TurboC++\Disk\TurboC3\BIN


I don't make recommendations; that would be too much like taking sides in commercial wars. Also, I don't know every C++ compiler; there are simply too many "out there".It is not neccesary to use DosBox/Turbo C++ compiler, one can choose the compiler of their own interest such as Code Blocks, Atom, Visual studio, Dev C++, Xcode(Mac), Clang(linux)



Enjoy! Happy Coding!
