        3. Take a number "n" as input "t" number of times.
        4. For each input value of n, print "prime" if the number is prime and "not prime" otherwise.

6.  Print All Primes Till N:

        1. You've to print all prime numbers between a range.
        2. Take as input "low", the lower limit of range.
        3. Take as input "high", the higher limit of range.
        4. For the range print all the primes numbers between low and high (both included).

7.  Print Fibonacci Numbers Till N:

        1. You've to print first n fibonacci numbers.
        2. Take as input "n", the count of fibonacci numbers to print.
        3. Print first n fibonacci numbers.

8.  Count Digits In A Number:

        1. You've to count the number of digits in a number.
        2. Take as input "n", the number for which the digits has to be counted.
        3. Print the digits in that number.

9.  Digits Of A Number:

        1. You've to display the digits of a number.
        2. Take as input "n", the number for which digits have to be displayed.
        3. Print the digits of the number line-wise.

10. Reverse A Number:

        1. You've to display the digits of a number in reverse.
        2. Take as input "n", the number for which digits have to be display in reverse.
        3. Print the digits of the number line-wise, but in reverse order.

11. Inverse Of A Number:

        1. You are given a number following certain constraints.
        2. The key constraint is if the number is 5 digits long, it'll contain all the digits from 1 to 5 without missing any and without repeating any. e.g. 23415 is a 5 digit long number containing all digits from 1 to 5 without missing and repeating any digit from 1 to 5.Take a look at few other valid numbers - 624135, 81456273 etc.Here are a few invalid numbers - 139, 7421357 etc.
        3. The inverse of a number is defined as the number created by interchanging the face value and index of digits of number.e.g. for 426135 (reading from right to left, 5 is in place 1, 3 is in place 2, 1 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 2 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6), the inverse will be 416253 (reading from right to left, 3 is in place 1, 5 is in place 2,2 is in place 3, 6 is in place 4, 1 is in place 5 and 4 is in place 6) More examples - inverse of 2134 is 1243 and inverse of 24153 is 24153
        4. Take as input number "n", assume that the number will follow constraints.
        5. Print it's inverse.

12. Rotate a number:

        1. You are given two numbers n and k. You are required to rotate n, k times to the right. If k is positive, rotate to the right i.e. remove rightmost digit and make it leftmost. Do the reverse for negative value of k. Also k can have an absolute value larger than number of digits in n.
        2. Take as input n and k.
        3. Print the rotated number.
        4. Note - Assume that the number of rotations will not cause leading 0's in the result. e.g. such an input will not be given:
            n = 12340056
            k = 3
            r = 05612340

13. Find GCD & LCM of two numbers:

        1. You are required to print the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
        2. You are also required to print the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the same numbers.
        3. Take input "num1" and "num2" as the two numbers. 4. Print their GCD and LCM.

14. Print prime factorisation:

        1. You are required to display the prime factorization of a number.
        2. Take as input a number n.
        3. Print all its prime factors from smallest to largest.

15. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Bulbs:

        1. You are given n number of bulbs. They are all switched off. A weird fluctuation in voltage hits the circuit n times. In the 1st fluctuation all bulbs are toggled, in the 2nd fluctuation every 2nd bulb is toggled, in the 3rd fluctuation every 3rd bulb is toggled and so on. You've to find which bulbs will be switched on after n fluctuations.
        2. Take as input a number n, representing the number of bulbs.
        3. Print all th

16. Pythagorean Triplet:

        1. You are required to check if a given set of numbers is a valid pythagorean triplet.
        2. Take as input three numbers a, b and c.
        3. Print true if they can form a pythagorean triplet and false otherwise.
