            o/p: 7

6.      1. You are given a string.
        2. You have to validate it. 
        3. validation criteria- string should contain alphanumeric characters only.
        4. blank spaces are allowed in between the string.
        For e.g. 
            i/p: X Ã† A-Xii
            o/p: false
            i/p: Joe Rogan8
            o/p: true

7.      1. You are given a string.
        2. You have to reverse that string using-
                a. auxiliary string
                b. without auxiliary string
        For e.g.
        i/p:  school
        o/p:  loohcs  

8.      1. You are given two strings.
        2. You have to compare them, whether they are equal or not.  
        For e.g.
        i/p: calendar
             Calendar
        o/p: false

9.      1. You are given a string. 
        2. You have to find duplicate characters in the string.
        Methods:
                a. using loops
                b. using hash table
                c. using bit method
        For e.g.
            i/p: maximilian
            o/p: a 2
                 i 3
                 m 2

10.     WAF that checks whether the input string is pallindrome or not.
        For e.g.
                i/p: abcba
                o/p: true
                i/p: string
                o/p: false

11.     WAf that checks whether the input string is an anagram or not.
        For e.g.
                i/p: medical decimal
                o/p: true
                i/p: street smart
                o/p: false

12.     1. You are given a string. 
        2. You have to print all palindromic substrings of the given string.

13.     1. You are given a string.
        2. You have to compress the given string in the following two ways -

        First compression -> The string should be compressed such that consecutive duplicates of characters are replaced with a single character.
            For "aaabbccdee", the compressed string will be "abcde".

        Second compression -> The string should be compressed such that consecutive duplicates of characters are replaced with the character and followed by the number of consecutive duplicates.
            For "aaabbccdee", the compressed string will be "a3b2c2de2".

14.     1. You are given a string that contains only lowercase and uppercase alphabets.
        2. You have to form a string that contains the difference of ASCII values of every two consecutive characters between those characters.
            For "abecd", the answer should be "a1b3e-2c1d", as
                'b'-'a' = 1
                'e'-'b' = 3
                'c'-'e' = -2
                'd'-'c' = 1
                
15.     1. You are given a string that contains only lowercase and uppercase alphabets. 
        2. You have to toggle the case of every character of the given string.

16.     1. You are given a string.
        2. You have to print all permutations of the given string iteratively.
