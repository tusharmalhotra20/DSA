1.  Increasing

        1. You are given a positive number n.
        2. You are required to print the counting from 1 to n, using recursion.
        3. You are required to not use any loops. Complete the body of printIncreasing function to achieve it.

2.  Decreasing:

        1. You are given a positive number n.
        2. You are required to print the counting from n to 1.
        3. You are required to not use any loops. Complete the body of print Decreasing function to achieve it.

3.  Increasing-Decreasing:

        1. You are given a positive number n.
        2. You are required to print the counting from n to 1 and back to n again.
        3. You are required to not use any loops. Complete the body of printIncDec function to achieve it. Don't change the signature of the function.

4.  Factorial:

        1. You are given a number n.
        2. You are required to calculate the factorial of the number. Don't change the signature of factorial function.

5.  Power Linear:

        1. You are given a number x.
        2. You are given another number n.
        3. You are required to calculate x raised to the power n. Don't change the signature of power function .

6.  Power Logarithmic:

        1. You are given a number x.
        2. You are given another number n.
        3. You are required to calculate x raised to the power n. Don't change the signature of power function.

7.  ZigZag:

        1. Here are a few sets of inputs and outputs for your reference
        Input1 -> 1
        Output1 -> 1 1 1

        Input2 -> 2
        Output2 -> 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2

        Input2 -> 3
        Output3 -> 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3

        2. Figure out the pattern and complete the recursive function pzz to achieve the above for any positive number n.

8.  Tower of Hanoi:

        1. There are 3 towers. Tower 1 has n disks, where n is a positive number. Tower 2 and 3 are empty.
        2. The disks are increasingly placed in terms of size such that the smallest disk is on top and largest disk is at bottom.
        3. You are required to
            3.1. Print the instructions to move the disks.
            3.2. from tower 1 to tower 2 using tower 3
            3.3. following the rules
                3.3.1 move 1 disk at a time.
                3.3.2 never place a smaller disk under a larger disk.
                3.3.3 you can only move a disk at the top.
